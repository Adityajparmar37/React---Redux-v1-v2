What is a Root Reducer?

The root reducer is the primary reducer that combines all other reducers in a Redux application. It acts as a single entry point for all reducers, delegating actions to the appropriate sub-reducers.

Why Use a Root Reducer?

    Organize the state by splitting it into smaller, manageable pieces.
    Allow different parts of the state to be handled by different reducers.
    Simplify the management of complex applications.
